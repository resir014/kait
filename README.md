> Experiments on React hooks.

Jumping in on the hooks bandwagon, I'm doing some experiments with [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). To do something different, I'm going to see how it's like to write hooks in pure TypeScript.

To do so, I'm using the [experimental typings](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/30036) for React hooks available from DefinitelyTyped. It's still in its early days, but looks good enough to me.

## Notes

This project is **highly experimental**, If you decide to use any of these in production... well, don't say I didn't warn you.
