> Experiments on React hooks.

Jumping in on the hooks bandwagon, I'm doing some experiments with [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). To do something different, I'm going to see how it's like to write hooks in pure TypeScript.

## Notes

This project is **highly experimental**, If you decide to use any of these in production... well, don't say I didn't warn you.
